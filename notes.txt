⚠ ??

⚠ where is this??

⚠ I think there is no unused styling
> - You style in different ways, why is that?
✅ Material ui styling now using withStyles because we cannot style its components directly.
    we could use styled-components package, but we already have withStyles for these components
    otherwise with scss external jsx, and no internal styles
    for conditional styling we have classNames
> - I dont think the sponsors should be part of the footer.
✅ Done
> - Your footer classnames should be changed. Fx links contain a lot more than links and bottom is actually at the top.
✅ Done
> - Hire alumni.json we should stick with a naming of keys. You change it around. fx graduation_date onlineCV i think we should use camelCase so: onlineCV
✅ Done
> - Hire index.js: line 21 why are you desctructuring the skills array when it is empty?
 ⚠  if you mean this line `skills = [...skills, ...alumni.skills]` I'm getting skills from `alumniList` and using destructuring to append skills to current empty array
> - The same with the status list
😃 also the same answer
> - Line 26 should maybe be called unique skills and unique statusList?
⚠ Later they will come from a database, so be default they will be unique,
> - Line 33 you have to explain me. Its a little heavy.
When we click on a skill (the buttons which contain skills), we are looking at the array `selectedSkills` if the clicked skill is not exists at this array we
add it. then we are filtering the `alumniList` according to this `selectedSkills` by looping `selectedSkills` and checking if this alumni have this skill
> - In general the filterHandler is tricky!
YES sure, it will be very easy and simple when we add a database and use an api to update and filter alumni
> - Line 93 why index + 1?
✅ just to not start the id with zero, anyway I replaced them to be using uuid package to generate random ids
> - Line 96 i would name selected. If it is selected it has the background color. The problem with the outlined and contained is that what if we want it to not be outlined when not selected. Then we need to change the name aswell. This we want to avoid
`contained` and `outlined` are options of `variant` property which is coming from material ui. they refer to the style.
> - Expansion panel line 22 and 23 is maybe a bit overkill
✅ Done
> - The layout content.js where are we using that?
At most of `pages` it like `container` in bootstrap framework. All boxes contain text are wrapped with it
> - layout.js line 65 there is some BEM there.
✅ deleted. it was coming from Kevin legacy repo
> - We should update the favicon
✅ updated to the logo








> - The navbar should show the elements on hover.
> - What is the difference between the navMenu and the nav-bar?
> - Consistent file naming. expansionPanel -> expansion-panel
> - All outcommented code should be removed
> - For the team.json there should be a key that defines is the members are core or not. Relying on people remembering the first 3 is core is difficult. And what if there comes more core people.
> - Item-card.js i think you can destructure in directly in the first destructure. But maybe that will be a little hard to read?
> - Line 184 you have the role in the classname, why?
> - zoomIn1 -> zoom-in-1
> - Line 210 you have to explain me
> - mewsletter, where is that used?
> - When opening a link in the navbar it hides the scroll or something weird. It results in the page going slightly to the left. Could be nice to fix.
> - What is the progressbar for?
> - Pages dashboard?
- Login?
> - Newsletter?
> - Privacy?
> - We should figure out what to do with these pages, cause they are reachable just not with links
